<h1>Some Achieved Projects</h1> 

<h2>International Software Engineering Project (Team Leader)</h2>

<p>For the course Software Engineering Process, Linnaeus University collaborated with LTur (which is one of the biggest travel agency in Germany 
for the development of their online booking system. Our team is selected for the duty and I have been assigned as Team Leader. I 
finalized the course with the grade of A. 
We built a web application which provides a web service from flights to hotel reservations. We used Open UP Agile process methodology. We also
designed a user friendly website for LTur. The company has changed some features and using the website (www.ltur.com) 

<br><b>Used Technology</b> JavaEE, Netbeans, Tomcat7, MySQL, Java JPA, Hibernate, JSF, SOAP, Servlets, 
Java, Scripts, JQuery, HTML, XHTML, CSS, PrimeFaces Framework

<h2>International Software Engineering Project 2</h2>

Parasoft is a software testing company which provides clients to test their applications on their high level simulated service based solutions. We developed Data Manager to virtualize the stubs of user applications and provide to the SUT a good simulated environment. 
<br>
<b>Used Technology:</b> JavaEE, Eclipse WTP,Tomcat8,MySQL,JDBC,JPA,Maven,Vaadin, Java,Apache Poi,Apache Shiro,SuperCVS,Junit and Astah for UML design.

<h2>License plate recognizer</h2> 

For the course Computer Technology II in Linnaeus University, I developed a license plate recognizer application with OpenCV. A simple web camera detects the car and its license plate, later recognizes the characters and sends the license plate to police server to check if the car has a registered problem. (Check system was a Mock system not real one, only for testing). 
<br>
<b>Used Technology:</b> C, C++, Python, OpenCV libraries, Image Processing Techniques

<h2>Atmel AVR 500&600 microchip programming with assembly</h2>

For the course Computer Technology in Linnaeus University, I programmed message sending application with AVR 500 and 600. From one microchip card to another I was able to send, receive and understand the text messages as a chat program. This was one of the beneficial projects to learn assembly low level language and electronic microcontroller programming.
<br>
<b>Used Technology:</b> Atmel AVR 500, 600, AVR Studio, Assembly

<h2> Java Applications</h2>

During my education life I developed tens of java applications, from games, parsers, basic compilers
to operating system synchronizing applications. I also have good knowledge of java GUI programming

<h2>Testing</h2> 

For the course Software Testing, Linnaeus University, I tested Google Chrome Frameworks and
Layouts, found some bugs, reported and provide solution to Google. Course taught me Test Driven
Development, Unit Testing, Environment Testing, System Testing, Automated Testing, Black White Box
testing etc.

<h2>Android Applications</h2>

From weather application to alarms, calendars, simple games I developed lots of application, so I quite
have knowledge of Android Application

<h2>My Bachelor Thesis</h2> 

I am analyzing the Intel Xeon Phi many cored co-processor with several parallel benchmarks to measure its performance and trying to optimize the parallel coding of the cores to get faster results from it. Xeon Phi is used by biggest systems in the world now and I am co-operating with Intel during my work period. After my research I will attend to the IEEE Computer Performance Conference in USA with my results at the end of 2014
